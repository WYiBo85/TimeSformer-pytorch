## TimeSformer - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05095">TimeSformer</a>, a pure and simple attention-based solution for reaching SOTA on video classification. This repository will only house the best performing variant, 'Divided Space-Time Attention', which is nothing more than attention along the time axis before the spatial.
